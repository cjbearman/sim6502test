# Functional tests for sim6502
This is a test package for my sim6502 golang code as found at https://github.com/cjbearman/sim6502

The test package is entirely based on https://github.com/Klaus2m5/6502_65C02_functional_tests/tree/master, which provides an excellent resource for 6502 assembly code for testing purposes.

# Usage

Check this pacakge out in the same parent directory as the sim6502 code, then from this directory run:

```
go test -v ./...
```
